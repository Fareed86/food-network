            <p class="vip-p">A native of Buxton, Maine, Danielle is a small town girl with a big city attitude.
                Classically trained in
                baking and pastry from Johnson & Wales University, Danielle has shared her talents in restaurants
                throughout Vacationland, from exciting, fast-paced Portland to the sleepy shores of Vinalhaven, an
                island off the coast of Rockland. Her work as a pastry chef has been highlighted in Down East magazine
                and the Portland Press Herald. Danielle loves to share her knowledge and experiences through great
                storytelling.
